# Snake Game

A classic Snake game built with Godot Engine. This is my first game development project, created while learning game development fundamentals.

## About

This is a modern take on the timeless Snake game where you control a growing snake, eat apples, and try not to crash into yourself or the walls. Built from scratch (coding with russ yotube channel), this project helped me understand core concepts like grid-based movement, collision detection, and game state management.

## Working on this project taught me:

- Grid-based game mechanics and coordinate systems  
- Input handling and responsive controls  
- Game state management (playing, game over, restart)  
- Scene management in Godot  
- Array manipulation for snake body segments  
- Random positioning algorithms (food spawning)  
- Collision detection systems
